# Health Monitoring System for Newborn Babies

This project is a health monitoring system designed for newborn babies. It utilizes Arduino and various sensors, such as gas sensors and temperature sensors, to track and monitor the health status of infants in real time.

## Project Description

The goal of this system is to provide a reliable and accessible way to monitor vital health parameters for newborns. By using affordable hardware and sensors, it aims to alert caregivers or medical staff to abnormal conditions quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of temperature and environmental gases
- Arduino-based hardware integration
- Alerts or notifications when abnormal values are detected
- Designed for ease of use and adaptability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Gas sensor(s)
- Temperature sensor(s)
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tanjimmostafa/health-monitoring.git
    ```
2. Connect the sensors to your Arduino according to the circuit diagram.
3. Open the relevant Arduino code files in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once set up, the system will continuously monitor the connected sensors and provide outputs or alerts based on the readings. Consult the code comments and documentation for more details on configuring thresholds or alert mechanisms.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests to improve the system or add new features.
